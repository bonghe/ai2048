# AI2048
The hardest version of 2048 you've ever played!

## How to play

You can play it on the this page. 
* [bonghe/ai2048](https://bonghe.github.io/ai2048/index.html)

It is recommended to play it on Google Chrome.

## Why so smart
This game has a deep learning model running by Tensorflow.js to decide where and what the new number is. 

Honestly, I have never got 2048 in this game.
